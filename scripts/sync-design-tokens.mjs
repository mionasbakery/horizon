// Syncs canonical design tokens from the ../design-system sibling repo into the theme.
// Builds @mionasbakery/design-tokens, reads its dist/tokens.flat.css (the fully
// resolved/flattened variant, with outputReferences disabled), validates it, and only then
// copies it verbatim into assets/design-tokens.css (committed). We deliberately use the flat
// variant rather than dist/tokens.css: the latter emits var() references to shared names like
// --letter-spacing-sm, and the theme declares some of those same names itself (in
// theme-styles-variables.liquid). If the theme's declaration loads after this stylesheet, it
// would silently win and the design-system's var() reference would resolve to the theme's value
// instead of the intended one. Flat, literal values make such collisions inert.
//
// Validation checks two things: every token the bridge snippet references is present, AND every
// one of those tokens carries the exact value the contract expects. Presence alone is not enough
// -- a token can exist, be spelled correctly, and still resolve to the wrong value if the source
// was ever repointed at dist/tokens.css (which would carry var(...) references instead of
// literals). We validate the source before copying so a failed sync leaves the theme's existing
// assets/design-tokens.css untouched. Run: npm run tokens:sync
